My Computer Science NEA

This project is being made for my computer sceince NEA for A-Level. 
I created a simple Point-Of-Sale Till system which could be used in a professional envirionment. 

My project was created in Unity Engine and utilised Networking and SQLite to create a Server-Client connection with database access. 

Originally this repository contained the Unity Files for the project. This was proving to be in-effient to keep uploading the files. I also ran out of LFS space to be able to do this. However, I will now be adding any Test/Final builds that I create (fully functioning .exe files) and adding the final versions of any scripts that I have created.
